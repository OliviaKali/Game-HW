# Physic Game

This project is a simple guessing game that I created using javascript. You play against the computer and try to guess the letter that it thought of.
You are allowed nine tries before you either win or lose and the game resets while tracking if your wins and losses.
This is a fun, interactive game that's purpose was to implement and practice the skills taught in RU Coding Bootcamp.
